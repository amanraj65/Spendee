Purpose

In today’s era, subscription services are common. Also, you have the usual array of rent and utilities to pay. Plus, money these days is a little tighter than it used to be comparatively speaking, and thus we can’t remember where our money goes.

Therefore, we decided to find an easier way to get rid of this problem. So as the name itself suggests, this project is an attempt to manage our daily expenses in a more efficient and manageable way.

This application allows people to eliminate any unnecessary expenses and figure out if they are able to survive themselves or if they really need to ask for help. Typically, people are able to optimize their spending by making correct decisions.

Instead of keeping a diary or a log of the expenses, this application enables the user to not just keep control of the expenses but also to generate and save reports. So, this application attempts to free the user with as much as possible the burden of manual calculation and to keep track of expenditures.

Scope

This application is for domestic use and for small retailers only and does not meet all the requirements of higher-level businesses.

It can take a good market as it is usable by anyone who is willing to manage their expenses and aiming to save for future investments and many more.
